	* clutter/src/color.ccg:
	* clutter/src/color.hg:
	* tools/m4/convert_cluttermm.m4: Finish wrapping the Color class.  There are
	a couple of utility functions that have a signature like:
	void darken(ClutterColor* src, ClutterColor*dest);
	These I wrapped to act on the 'this' object (e.g. darken(this, this))
	instead of returning a modified copy of the Color.  I did this because
	otherwise you wouldn't have any way to darken the current object directly,
	you'd have to do something like:
	Color foo;
	Color darkened_foo = foo.darken();
	// now use the darkened color you wanted and throw away foo

	This means, of course, that if you *do* want to create a darkened copy, you
	have to create the copy manually, e.g.:
	Color foo;
	Color darkened_foo = foo;
	darkened_foo.darken();
	There are drawbacks to both approaches, but I think the second is more
	flexible and feels better to me.

	* clutter/src/color.ccg:
	* clutter/src/color.hg: implemented operator+ and operator- for the Color
	class and re-implemented .add() and .subtract() with these new operators.
	Also made add() and subtract() const since they don't modify the object,
	they return a new object.
